# Auction house V2

## ðŸ”– About
- Auction House V2 is an open-source smart contract with a low level SDK for dApps, designed to easily integrate support for compressed NFT auctions. Compressed NFTs, a new standard on Solana, currently lack support in developer tools. With Auction House V2, dApps can effortlessly incorporate auction and marketplace features without the need to invest time and money in building a secure contract, especially beneficial for early dApps that can concentrate on developing their core product.

- Match bid and sell orders and execute sale
